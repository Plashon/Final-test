            <h3>best game of the year</h3>
            <p>
              From a purely financial perspective, 2022 was a down year for
              video games. Overall sales have swooned since 2021, which analysts
              have chalked up to both regression from the COVID boom and the
              lack of a central, needle-moving blockbuster on the release
              schedule. It’s hard to squabble with that point as you take stock
              of the cycle; 2022 did not contain a marquee installment to a
              galactic franchise — Starfield, Final Fantasy XVI, and The Legend
              of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are each earmarked for 2023.
              Instead, we received a constant trickle of eccentric, offbeat
              projects that seemed destined to appeal, unapologetically, to a
              very specific type of video-game fetishist. Our top-ten list for
              2022 contains ’90s-worshipping arcade throwbacks, wooly economic
              simulators, eldritch dungeon crawls, and ultra-high-concept RPGs.

            <h3>Deliver Us The Moon</h3>
            <p>
              Deliver Us the Moon is a puzzle adventure game experienced at
              various points of the narrative from either a first-person or a
              third-person perspective, which is determined by the type of
              action that must be completed. For example, the camera shifts to a
              first-person perspective when the player controls a floating robot
              tied to a puzzle. The player assumes the role of an astronaut who
              is launched to the moon on board a space shuttle to investigate a
              series of seemingly-abandoned facilities, where an important
              resource which plays a vital role in solving an energy crisis on
              Earth is mined for use.
